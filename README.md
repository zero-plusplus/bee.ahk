**This library will be created in the future. The current working branch is [alpha](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/bee.ahk/tree/alpha).**

The contents will be a reorganization of my personal library.

I have another project that supports AutoHotkey, so the pace of creation will be slow. Please be patient.

I will eventually create a library for each version, but I will give priority to v2. If you have any questions or ideas, please comment in the [discussion](https://github.com/zero-plusplus/bee.ahk/discussions).

If you want to try it out, copy the src folder to your project's lib folder, or install it using npm as follows.
```
npm install -D github:zero-plusplus/bee.ahk#alpha
```
